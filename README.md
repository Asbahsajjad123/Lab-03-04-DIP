Apply Histogram equalization on image and proved enhanced color image. Do histogram by first using builtin function and then write function of Histogram containing each step and then compare the result of both. Also appy contrast stretching on this image using diffrent transformation functions and compare its result with Histogram Equalization.
# Code Explanation
This code demonstrates several image enhancement techniques using OpenCV and Python. First, the image is uploaded at runtime in Google Colab, read using OpenCV, converted from BGR to RGB, and displayed. Then, built-in histogram equalization is applied by converting the image into YCrCb color space and equalizing only the Y (luminance) channel to improve brightness and contrast without changing colors. After that, manual histogram equalization is implemented by converting the image to grayscale, calculating the histogram, computing and normalizing the cumulative distribution function (CDF), and mapping old pixel values to new ones; both the equalized image and its histogram are displayed for comparison with the original. Next, contrast stretching is performed by expanding the grayscale intensity range from its minimum and maximum values to the full 0–255 range, improving visibility of details. Finally, log and gamma transformations are applied on the grayscale image to enhance dark regions (log transform) and adjust overall brightness (gamma transform). The final section displays the original grayscale image along with the log-transformed and gamma-transformed images to visually compare their effects.
